                <h2>About Uranus</h2>
                <p>
                    Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It is a gaseous cyan-coloured ice giant. Most of the planet is made of water, ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase of matter, which astronomy calls "ice" or volatiles. The planet's atmosphere has a complex layered cloud structure and has the lowest minimum temperature (49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F)) of all the Solar System's planets. Like the other giant planets, Ur anus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and many natural satellites.                </p>

                    <li><strong>Interesting Fact:</strong> Uranus is the only planet that rotates "on its side," meaning its axis is almost parallel to its orbit, giving it a unique "tilted" spin.</li>
