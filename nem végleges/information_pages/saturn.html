                <h2>About Saturn</h2>
                <p>
                    Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant, with an average radius of about nine times that of Earth. Even though Saturn is almost as big as Jupiter, Saturn has less than a third the mass of Jupiter. Saturn's interior is thought to be composed of a rocky core, surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and an outer layer of gas.                </p>
