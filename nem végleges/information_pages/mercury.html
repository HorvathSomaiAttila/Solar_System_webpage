                <h2>About Mercury</h2>
                <p>
                    Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System. The surface has widely varying temperature, with the equatorial regions ranging from −170 °C (−270 °F) at night to 420 °C (790 °F) during sunlight. The surface of Mercury is heavily cratered, as a result of countless impact events that have accumulated over billions of years. Its largest crater, Caloris Planitia, has a diameter of 1,550 km (960 mi), which is about one-third the diameter of the planet (4,880 km or 3,030 mi).

                    <li><strong>Orbit:</strong> 0.39 AU from the Sun</li>
                    <li><strong>Interesting Fact:</strong> Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System, and since it has no atmosphere, daytime temperatures can soar to 430°C, while nighttime temperatures can drop to -180°C!</li>
