                <h2>About Sedna</h2>
                <p>
                    Sedna is a dwarf planet in the outermost reaches of the Solar System, orbiting the Sun beyond the orbit of Neptune. Discovered in 2003, the planetoid's surface is one of the reddest known among Solar System bodies. Spectroscopy has revealed Sedna's surface to be mostly a mixture of the solid ices of water, methane, and nitrogen, along with widespread deposits of reddish-colored tholins, a chemical makeup similar to those of some other trans-Neptunian objects. Within the range of uncertainties, it is tied with the dwarf planet Ceres in the asteroid belt as the largest dwarf planet not known to have a moon. Its diameter is roughly 1,000 km (most likely in between those of Ceres and Saturn's moon Tethys). Owing to its lack of known moons, the Keplerian laws of planetary motion cannot be employed for determining its mass, and the precise figure remains as yet unknown.                 </p>

                    <li><strong>Diameter:</strong> 1000 km</li>
                    <li><strong>Orbit:</strong> 76.3 AU from the Sun at closest <br>
                    936 AU at the farthest in its highly elliptical orbit</li>
                    <li><strong>Interesting Fact:</strong> Sedna has one of the most distant orbits of any known object in the solar system. Its orbit takes it so far from the Sun that it may never return to the inner solar system.</li>
