                <h2>About Eris</h2>
                <p>
                    Eris is the most massive and second-largest known dwarf planet in the Solar System. It is a trans-Neptunian object (TNO) in the scattered disk and has a high-eccentricity orbit. Eris was discovered in January 2005 by a Palomar Observatory–based team led by Mike Brown and verified later that year. It was named in September 2006 after the Greco–Roman goddess of strife and discord. Eris is the ninth-most massive known object orbiting the Sun and the sixteenth-most massive overall in the Solar System (counting moons). It is also the largest known object in the solar system that has not been visited by a spacecraft. Eris has been measured at 2,326 ± 12 kilometres in diameter; its mass is 0.28% that of the Earth and 27% greater than that of Pluto, although Pluto is slightly larger by volume. Both Eris and Pluto have a surface area that is comparable to that of Russia or South America.                </p>

                    <li><strong>Diameter:</strong> 2,326 km</li>
                    <li><strong>Orbit:</strong> 96.3 AU from the Sun</li>
                    <li><strong>Interesting Fact:</strong> Eris is slightly smaller than Pluto but has a greater mass. It was discovered in 2005 and played a significant role in the reclassification of Pluto as a "dwarf planet."</li>
