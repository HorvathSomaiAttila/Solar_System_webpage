                <p>
                    Venus is the second planet from the Sun. Earth is the only place in the universe where life and surface liquid water are known to exist. Earth's atmosphere contains 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, which is the result of the presence of life. The planet has a complex climate and weather system, with conditions differing drastically between climate regions. The solid surface of Earth is dominated by green vegetation, deserts and white ice sheets.                </p>

                    <li><strong>Diameter:</strong> 12,742 km</li>
                    <li><strong>Orbit:</strong> 1 AU from the Sun (149.6 million km)</li>
                    <li><strong>Interesting Fact:</strong> Earth's rotation is slowing down over time. In about 140 million years, a day on Earth will be 25 hours long instead of 24. <br>
                        A day on Earth isn't exactly 24 hours. It's actually 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds â€“ the time it takes for Earth to complete a full rotation relative to distant stars.</li>
